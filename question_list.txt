Current Technologies:
---------------------
Rails (Framework)
Rack    (HTTP Responder)
Capistrano (Deploying / Starting)
Thin / Webrick / Unicorn (HTTP Server)
NGinx (Reverse Proxy)
Passenger (???)
MySQL (Database)


Proposed Technologies:
----------------------
God (Process Management)
Chef (Capistrano Consistency?)
Faye (PubSub)
ElasticSearch (Search)
REDIS (Key / Value Store)
Resque (Background Tasks)


Questions:
----------
1. Why do we need both Rack & Unicorn? (Division of responsibilities?)
2. What does Passenger do, and why do we want to use it?
3. Given our other technologies, do we want God, and if so, why?
4. If we have our Capistrano recipe written, why would we want Chef?
5. Please spell out *exactly* what a Persistence server does?
6. Which piece is responsible for spinning up services for load management?
7. Chef-solo seems very difficult to launch. Should we continue to investiage?
8. Let's say I wanted to run Son of Store Engine and Pointsfeed on the same box. I've just started
   a new Linode instance. What should I do, and in what order? Where would I go to learn that?
